# libft
As a first project I am going to build a library that contains functions from the standard C library. These functions will be very useful throughout future projects.
Since I am emulating the behavior of some libc functions I must understand when they work correctly and when they should fail. 

In brief:  


	
 	ft_memcpy() -----> The strlen() function in libc is used to calculate 
  	the length of a string in bytes, excluding the terminating null byte (\0). 
   
  	ft_memmove() ---->
   	ft_memset() ----->
	ft_strnstr() ---->
 	ft_itoa() ------->
  	ft_split() ------>
   	ft_strtrim() ---->
	ft_putnbr_fd() -->
